## Setting up development environment

To be able to build gateware one has to have Vivado installed and set the environment variables correctly (see `gateware/build_fpga_image.sh`). 

Using python virtual environment is recommended. To install packages from this repository, as well as external python packages (MiSoC and Fast-Servo-Firmware) run (from the root of this repo and inside the python virtual environment) `install.sh` script.
